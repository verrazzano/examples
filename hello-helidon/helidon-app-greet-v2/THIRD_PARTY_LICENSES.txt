# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
         Distributed under this Agreement, and

      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         i) changes to the Program, and
         ii) additions to the Program;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
      are not Modified Works.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
    or Modified Works thereof.

    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation source, and configuration files.

    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
    Contributor.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
      licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
      used for software exchange; and

      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
         for a particular purpose;

         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
         of this section 3.

    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
      the Program.

    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
    their own appropriate notices.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
    participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
    those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
    Contributions) under the new version.

    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
      look for such a notice.

      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
    Boston, MA 02110-1335
    USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
    is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
        is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
    along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
    Program or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
    a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
    limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
    Free Software Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
        Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
        General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
        James Hacker.

        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
        Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
    General Public License instead of this License.

---

## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
    combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
    from your version.

# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
         Distributed under this Agreement, and

      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
         i) changes to the Program, and 
         ii) additions to the Program;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
      are not Modified Works.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
    or Modified Works thereof.

    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation source, and configuration files.

    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
    Contributor.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
      licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
      used for software exchange; and

      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
         for a particular purpose;

         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
         of this section 3.

    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
      the Program.

    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
    their own appropriate notices.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
    participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
    those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
    Contributions) under the new version.

    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
      look for such a notice.

      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
    Boston, MA 02110-1335
    USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
    is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
        is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
    along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
    Program or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
    a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
    limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
    Free Software Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
        Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
        General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
        James Hacker.

        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
        Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
    General Public License instead of this License.

---

## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
    combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
    from your version.

# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
    1. DEFINITIONS
    
    “Contribution” means:
    
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
            i) changes to the Program, and
            ii) additions to the Program;
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
    
    “Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
    
    “Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
    
    “Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
    
    “Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
    
    “Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
    
    “Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.
    
    “Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
    
    “Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
    
    “Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
    
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
        e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
    
    3. REQUIREMENTS
    
    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
    
        a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
        b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
            i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
            ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
            iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
            iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
    
    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
    
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
    
    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
    
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
    
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
    5. NO WARRANTY
    
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
    
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    7. GENERAL
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
    
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
    
    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
    Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
    
    “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”
    
        Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
    
        If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
    
        You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
        PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
        OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

    1. DEFINITIONS

    "Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
         Distributed under this Agreement, and

      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         i) changes to the Program, and
         ii) additions to the Program;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
      "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
      are not Modified Works.

    "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.

    "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.

    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

    "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
    Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
    interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
    in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
    or Modified Works thereof.

    "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
    in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

    "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
    modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
    documentation source, and configuration files.

    "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
    Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
    exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
    Contributor.

    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
      licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

    3. REQUIREMENTS

    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
      used for software exchange; and

      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
         for a particular purpose;

         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
         of this section 3.

    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
      the Program.

    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
    of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
    their own appropriate notices.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
    participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
    those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
    Contributions) under the new version.

    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

    "This Source Code may also be made available under the following
    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
      look for such a notice.

      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

##    The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
    Boston, MA 02110-1335
    USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
    to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
    is true depends on what the Program does.

    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
        under the terms of this License.

        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
        is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
    scope of this License.

    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
        of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,

        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
        accord with Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
    executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
    along with the object code.

    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.

    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
    Program or works based on it.

    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
    by public license practices. Many people have made generous
    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
    the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
    a consequence of the rest of this License.

    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
    limitation as if written in the body of this License.

    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
    Free Software Foundation.

    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
        Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
        General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:

        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
        `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
        it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
    you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
    could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

        Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
        program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
        James Hacker.

        signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
        Ty Coon, President of Vice

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
    with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
    General Public License instead of this License.

---

## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
    making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
    conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
    combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
    terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
    independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
    module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
    based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
    exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
    do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
    from your version.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
